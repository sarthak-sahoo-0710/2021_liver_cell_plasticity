# Bifurcation Analysis (Figure 5A, 6B, 6D)

## Core Bifurcation
The folder `core_bifurcation` contains codes and corresponding data and plots for Fig. 5A.

`code_v3.py` - Python script to generate the data for individual branches of the bifurcation diagram for different genes in the gene regulatory network.

`code_plot_bifurcation.py` - Python script to plot bifurcation diagrams from the generated data.

The corresponding raw data and figure pannels are present in the folders `Data` and `Plots` respectively.


## Irreversible-Reversible
The folder "core_bifurcation_irreversible_reversible" contains codes and corresponding data and plots for Fig. 6B.

`code_v3.py` - Python script to generate the data for individual branches for the two bifurcation diagrams (reversible and irreversible) for different genes in the gene regulatory network.

`code_plot_bifurcation.py` - Python script to plot bifurcation diagrams from the generated data.

The corresponding raw data and figure pannels are present in the folders `Data` and `Plots` respectively.




## Locking Mechanism
The folder "core_bifurcation_locking_mechansim" contains codes and corresponding data and plots for Fig. 6D.

`code_v3_high_sox9_to_cebpa_link.py` - Python script to generate the data for individual branches of the bifurcation diagram when there is a high degree of supression from SOX9 to CEBPA for different genes in the gene regulatory network.

`code_v3_low_sox9_to_cebpa_link.py` - Python script to generate the data for individual branches of the bifurcation diagram when there is a low degree of supression from SOX9 to CEBPA for different genes in the gene regulatory network.


`code_plot_bifurcation.py` - Python script to plot bifurcation diagrams from the generated data.

The corresponding raw data and figure pannels are present in the folders `Data` and `Plots` respectively.
